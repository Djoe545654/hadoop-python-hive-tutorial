# Hadoop MapReduce with Python

A tutorial for writing a MapReduce program for Hadoop in python.

This uses the Hadoop Streaming API with python to teach the basics of using the MapReduce framework.
The main idea and structure is based on [Michael G. Noll's great tutorial](http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/writing-an-hadoop-mapreduce-program-in-python/). However, that tutorial is outdated and quite few of the steps do not work anymore, both in setting up and running Hadoop. This is an updated and expanded tutorial.

## Let's Begin

[Setup your Hadoop cluster](setup.md)
[Write your first Python MapReduce program](mapreduce.md)
